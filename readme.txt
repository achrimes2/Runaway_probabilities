Code to calculate the probability of detecting a runaway, as described in Chrimes et al. 2023.

An example is shown in example_calc.py, which used the function 'calculate_probability' in runaway_calc.py.

Inputs:
Distance [pc]
Av
Filter (g,r,i,J,H,K,G,GBP or GRP)
maglim 
pmlim [mas/yr]

Where maglim is the limiting magnitude and pmlim is the minimum measurable proper motion.

N.b. Gaia magnitudes are in the Vega system, others are in AB.

For sub-divisions by SN type, other filters, other kick distributions or other metallicities (here we assume Z=0.020), get in touch!
